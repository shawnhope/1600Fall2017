Scope and Access Modifiers
 Scope is more or less the syntax, each block of code is one more or less the scope of a variable. Variables in the field can be used throughout the script, variables in blocks only in the blocks. Access Modifiers are the public/private/protected, if its private, it can't be used outside the script, public can be called by other scripts, protected can be called by child scripts.

//-----------------------------------------------
//#1 public modifier needs to be stated
//#2 x can be used in script and by other scripts
public int x = 8;

//#3 private method by default
void start()
{
//#4 private access modifier by default
//#5 y only exists in this Box method
int y = 9;

	if(x == 7)
		print("x equals 7");
	else if(x == 8)
		//#6 prints because x is public, it can be accessed in method
		print(y);
	else if(x == 10)
		//#7 won't print because z is not in this method block
		print(z);
	else
		print("what");
	
	//#8 method private by default
	void Box2(){
		//#9 variable private by default (can it even be public?)
		int z = 10;
		//#10 prints x because x is public
		print(x);
	}
