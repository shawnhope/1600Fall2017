Variables

Variables are types that have been assigned an identifier or value so that they can be recalled later for functions (and methods and statements?). They're closed with semicolons. Values can be stated immediately or later, and values can be changed or unchangable depending on if used as Value type or Reference?

	int slice = 4;			//variables
	var pi = 3.14;
	in plenty = 1;
	string welp = "ya nasty";
	string ok = "you done gud";	

	int myLunch(slice * pi)		//function
	{
		if myLunch > plenty = true;
	
			Console.WriteLine(welp);
	
		else
			Console.WriteLine(ok);
	}

//no idea if this would even run
