Conventions and Syntax

Syntax is the format of the c# language; its the order that certain things have to be written and blocked out.

//always starts with using
usint System;
using UnityEngine;

//class declaration, private or public depending on if you want it used elsewhere
public class Syntax 
{

		//variables; semicolons to differenciate
		int myNumber = 2;
		var myOtherNum = 4;	

	/*Method(?); always needs a start, void doesn't return anything, no semicolon because it hasn't got a block to run anything yet*/
	void Start () {
		//Funtion?(parameters);
		print(myNumber + myOtherNum);
			}
			//always close curlies
}
