branchThreeFile
//first commit comment
made branchThree off of branchOne, so shouldn't have branchTwoFile, right?

//second commit comment
Noticed the visual branching in Kraken after adding branchThreeFile, still mildly confused.
//technically third commit comment
should be a good example for which it rewrites when I merge..
